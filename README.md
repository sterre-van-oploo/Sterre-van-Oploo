Hi my name is Sterre and I am learning to code :D. I know some HTML and CSS (since april 2021) and I am currently learning C# (since september 2023)! I love listening to music, everything between indie rock to classic. I have variating hobbies like: drawing, playing the guitar, going on long walks and making art.
